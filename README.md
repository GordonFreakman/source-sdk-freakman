# Open Freakman: Gordon Freakman 1

Cleaned up and easily portable version of Gordon Freakman 1's source code provided by the original author [Wirelex.exe](https://wirelexexe.github.io/)
## Alternatively, the original source code is here too!
The branch `original_src` contains the original source code as provided by Wirelex. but its very messy and harder to port to a clean SDK.
